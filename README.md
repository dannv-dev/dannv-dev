# Hi, I'm Dan 👋

I'm a 20-year-old Front-End Web Developer from England 🇬🇧 with a strong passion for building elegant and performant user interfaces using **React** and **TypeScript**.

Although I don't have formal work experience yet, I've spent the past **4 years honing my development skills** through personal projects, online learning, and constant experimentation. My goal is to create intuitive, accessible, and responsive web experiences that make a difference.
